**Lilium Arena Classic** is a fork of ioEF and [Lilium Arena](https://github.com/zturtleman/lilium-arena) that is compatible with Quake 3 1.16n and versions back to Quake 3 Demo Test 1.09. It supports Quake 3 protocol 43 (.dm3 demo files) and the older QVM Mod APIs.

Credit for Quake 3 protocol 43 goes to Thilo Schulz (for ioEF) and Zack Middleton.

Currently QVM float rounding is only correct on x86/x86_64 so it's not ready for Arm, PowerPC, etc.
