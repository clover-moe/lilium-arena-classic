**Lilium Arena Classic** is an engine compatible with Quake 3 1.16n and versions back to Quake 3 Demo Test 1.09. It supports Quake 3 protocol 43 (.dm3 demo files) and the older QVM Mod APIs.


## About

Credit for Quake 3 protocol 43 goes to Thilo Schulz (for ioEF) and Zack Middleton.

Currently QVM float rounding is only correct on x86/x86_64 so it's not ready for Arm, PowerPC, etc.

Lilium Arena Classic is based on [Lilium Arena](https://github.com/clover-moe/lilium-arena).

The source code for the Quake 3 1.16n game, cgame, and ui code is not included as it remains under a non-free license.

## Contributing

High quality code contributions are more helpful than rushed contributions.

Reviewing pull requests is sometimes more work than a reviewer doing the work in the first place so pull requests may be disregarded.
